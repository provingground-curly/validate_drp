def measurePA2(metric, pa1, pf1_thresh): 
    """Measurement of PA2: millimag from median RMS (see PA1) of which
    PF1 of the samples can be found.

    Parameters
    ----------
    metric : `lsst.verify.Metric`
        A PA2 `~lsst.verify.Metric` instance.
    pa1 : `lsst.verify.Measurement`
        A PA1 measurement instance.
    pf1_thresh : `astropy.units.Quantity`
        Quantity specifying the threshold at which to calculate PA2

    Returns
    -------
    measurement : `lsst.verify.Measurement`
        Measurement of PA2 and associated metadata.

    Notes
    -----
    The LSST Science Requirements Document (LPM-17) is commonly referred
    to as the SRD.  The SRD puts a limit that no more than PF1 % of difference
    will vary by more than PA2 millimag.  The design, minimum, and stretch
    goals are PF1 = (10, 20, 5) % at PA2 = (15, 15, 10) millimag following
    LPM-17 as of 2011-07-06, available at http://ls.st/LPM-17.
