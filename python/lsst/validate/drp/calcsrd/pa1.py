    Parameters
    ----------

        `~lsst.afw.table.GroupView` of stars matched between visits,
        from MultiMatch, provided by
        `lsst.validate.drp.matchreduce.MatchedMultiVisitDataset`.

        where ``allMatches`` is the result of
        `lsst.afw.table.MultiMatch.finish()`.

    Returns
    -------
    statistics : `dict`
        Statistics to compute PA1. Fields are:

        - ``PA1``: scalar `~astropy.unit.Quantity` of mean ``iqr``. This is
          formally the PA1 metric measurement.
        - ``rms``: `~astropy.unit.Quantity` array in mmag of photometric
          repeatability RMS across ``numRandomShuffles``.
          Shape: ``(nRandomSamples,)``.
        - ``iqr``: `~astropy.unit.Quantity` array in mmag of inter-quartile
          range of photometric repeatability distribution.
          Shape: ``(nRandomSamples,)``.
        - ``magDiff``: `~astropy.unit.Quantity` array of magnitude differences
          between pairs of stars. Shape: ``(nRandomSamples, nMatches)``.
        - ``magMean``: `~astropy.unit.Quantity` array of mean magnitudes of
          each pair of stars. Shape: ``(nRandomSamples, nMatches)``.

    Notes
    -----
    We calculate differences for ``numRandomShuffles`` different random
    realizations of the measurement pairs, to provide some estimate of the
    uncertainty on our RMS estimates due to the random shuffling.  This
    estimate could be stated and calculated from a more formally derived
    motivation but in practice 50 should be sufficient.

    The LSST Science Requirements Document (LPM-17), or SRD, characterizes the
    photometric repeatability by putting a requirement on the median RMS of
    measurements of non-variable bright stars.  This quantity is PA1, with a
    design, minimum, and stretch goals of (5, 8, 3) millimag following LPM-17
    as of 2011-07-06, available at http://ls.st/LPM-17.

    This present routine calculates this quantity in two different ways:

    1. RMS
    2. interquartile range (IQR)

    **The PA1 scalar measurement is the median of the IQR.**

    This function also returns additional quantities of interest:

    - the pair differences of observations of stars,
    - the mean magnitude of each star

    While the SRD specifies that we should just compute the RMS directly, the
    current filter doesn't screen out variable stars as carefully as the SRD
    specifies, so using a more robust estimator like the IQR allows us to
    reject some outliers.  However, the IRQ is also less sensitive some
    realistic sources of scatter such as bad zero points, that the metric
    should include.

    Because we have N>=2 measurements for each star, we select a random

    Returns

    Notes
    -----

    - As implemented the returned value is the result of subtracting
      two elements of the input array.  In all of the imagined uses
      that's going to be a scalar (float, maybe int).
      In principle, however the code as implemented returns the result
      of subtracting two elements of the array, which could be any
      arbitrary object that is the result of the subtraction operator
      applied to two elements of the array.

    - This is not the most efficient way to extract a pair,
      but it's the easiest to write.

    - Shuffling works correctly for low N (even N=2), where a naive
      random generation of entries would result in duplicates.

    - In principle it might be more efficient to shuffle the indices,
      then extract the difference.  But this probably only would make a
      difference for arrays whose elements were objects that were
      substantially larger than a float.  And that would only make
      sense for objects that had a subtraction operation defined.
