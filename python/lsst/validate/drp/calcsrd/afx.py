def measureAFx(metric, amx, adx, adx_spec):
    """Measurement of AFx (x=1,2,3): The maximum fraction of astrometric
    distances which deviate by more than ADx milliarcsec (see AMx) (%).

    Parameters
    ----------
    metric : `lsst.verify.Metric`
        AF1, AF2 or AF3 `~lsst.verify.Metric` instance.
    amx : :class:`lsst.verify.Measurement`
        An AMx measurement, providing the median astrometric scatter in
        the annulus.
    adx : :class:`lsst.verify.Measurement`
        An ADx measurement
    adx_spec : :class:`lsst.verify.Spec`
        An instance of a `lsst.verify.Spec` containing the threshold against
        which to measure.

    Returns
    -------
    An `lsst.verify.Measurement` containing the measured value of AFx (x=1,2,3) and associated metadata.

    LPM-17 dated 2011-07-06

    Specification:
        The rms of the astrometric distance distribution for
        stellar pairs with separation of D arcmin (repeatability)
        will not exceed AMx milliarcsec (median distribution for a large number
        of sources). No more than AFx % of the sample will deviate by more than
        ADx milliarcsec from the median. AMx, AFx, and ADx are specified for
        D=5, 20 and 200 arcmin for x= 1, 2, and 3, in the same order (Table 18).

    The three selected characteristic distances reflect the size of an
    individual sensor, a raft, and the camera. The required median astrometric
    precision is driven by the desire to achieve a proper motion accuracy of
    0.2 mas/yr and parallax accuracy of 1.0 mas over the course of the survey.
    These two requirements correspond to relative astrometric precision for a
    single image of 10 mas (per coordinate).
