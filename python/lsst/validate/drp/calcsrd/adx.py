def measureADx(metric, amx, afx_spec):
    """Measurement of AFx (x=1,2,3): The maximum fraction of astrometric
    distances which deviate by more than ADx milliarcsec (see AMx) (%).

    Parameters
    ----------
    metric : `lsst.verify.Metric`
        AD1, AD2, or AD3 `~lsst.verify.Metric` instance.
    amx : `lsst.verify.Measurement`
        And AMx measurement, providing the median astrometric scatter in
        the annulus.
    afx_spec : `lsst.verify.Spec`
        Specification containing the value of the level to measure against (e.g., design,
        minimum, stretch).

    Returns
    -------
    measurement : `lsst.verify.Measurement`
        Measurement of ADx (x=1,2,3) and associated metadata.

    LPM-17 dated 2011-07-06

    Specification:
        The rms of the astrometric distance distribution for
        stellar pairs with separation of D arcmin (repeatability)
        will not exceed AMx milliarcsec (median distribution for a large number
        of sources). No more than AFx % of the sample will deviate by more than
        ADx milliarcsec from the median. AMx, AFx, and ADx are specified for
        D=5, 20 and 200 arcmin for x= 1, 2, and 3, in the same order (Table 18).

    The three selected characteristic distances reflect the size of an
    individual sensor, a raft, and the camera. The required median astrometric
    precision is driven by the desire to achieve a proper motion accuracy of
    0.2 mas/yr and parallax accuracy of 1.0 mas over the course of the survey.
    These two requirements correspond to relative astrometric precision for a
    single image of 10 mas (per coordinate).
